            <h2>Kickoff Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>All players (except the player taking the kickoff) must be in their half of the field.</li>
                <li>The ball must be stationary on the center spot.</li>
                <li>The kicker taking the kickoff must not touch the ball again until another player touches it.</li>
                <li>The opponents of the team taking the kickoff must be at least 9.15 meters (10 yards) away from the ball.</li>
                <li>The ball is considered "in play" when it is kicked and moves.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The first <a href="https://www.soccer.com/guide/rules-of-soccer-guide"  target="_blank">basic rule</a> in soccer: <strong>No hands</strong>. The goalkeeper (goalie) is the only player on the field who can use their hands. All other players must use their feet, head, or chest to control the ball. If the player touches the ball, it’s considered a handball and a foul.</li>
                <li><strong>Throw-ins</strong>: When the ball goes out of bounds on the sidelines, the team who didn’t touch it last gets to throw the ball back into play.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal kicks and corner kicks</strong>: When the ball goes out of bounds behind the goal line (not resulting in a goal), the goalkeeper of the team who didn’t touch it last gets to kick the ball back into play. If the ball goes out of bounds on the sideline in front of the goal, the team who didn’t touch it last gets a corner kick.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct and indirect kicks</strong>: Players can score on a direct kick, which is a kick that goes directly into the goal without another player touching it. An indirect kick is when another player must touch the ball before it can go into the goal.</li>
                <li><strong>No time limit for possession</strong>: There is no time limit on how long a team can keep the ball.</li>
                <li><strong>The clock doesn't stop</strong>: The game clock does not stop, even if the ball goes out of bounds or there is an injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Stoppage time</strong>: If the referee deems it necessary, he may add extra time at the end of each half. This is called stoppage time or injury time.</li>
                <li><strong>Offside rule</strong>: The offside rule is one of the most misunderstood rules in soccer. The basic idea is that a player cannot be in an advantageous position when the ball is played to them. Being in an offside position is not in itself an offense. An offside offense occurs when a player is in the opponent’s half of the field and closer to their goal than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent. </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Fouls and Free Kicks</h2>
            <dl>
            <dt><strong>Actions that result in a foul and a free kick will be awarded to the opposing team</strong>:</dt>
            <dd>Tripping, pushing, holding an opponent, hitting, kicking, spitting on an opponent, tackling from behind, charging into an opponent, touching the ball with your hands (if you aren't the goalkeeper).</dd>
                <dt><strong>Specific rules for the goalkeeper</strong>:</dt>
                <dd>The goalkeeper cannot take control of the ball with their hands away from the penalty spot, hold the ball for more than 6 seconds, touch the ball with their hands after a teammate purposefully kicks it to them, or touch the ball with their hands directly after a throw-in by a teammate. </dd>
